# Hashtables
- HashTables are great for storing information into array lists!
- My VSC wouldn't let me implement my linkedlist, so I was unable to utilize my add function...

## Efficiency
Time Efficiency:

- add : O(1)
- get : O(1)
- contains : O(1)

Space Efficiency:

- add : O(1)
- get : O(1)
- contains : O(1)

## Features
- add(): The add method allows the user to add more keys+values to the array list.
- get(): The get method can be utilized to get a key/value from an array list.
- contains(): Much like the get method, however, contains will return a boolean telling the user whether or not the key they searched is in the array list.
- hash(): This method hashes the keys, meaning, it turns words into numerical values.

## Whiteboard
No whiteboard required.
