# Daily Code Challenge - Stacks and Queues

## Perfect Sequence
*Author: Matthew Petersen*

---

### Problem Domain

Write the following methods that implement a Stack : isEmpty, Pop, Push and Peek

Write the following methods that implement a Queue : isEmpty, Enqueue, Dequeue and Peek.

---

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

| Method | Summary | Example | 
| :-------- | :--------------------- |:----------- |
| isEmpty | Returns a boolean if stack is empty | isEmpty() |
| Pop | Removes first value in stack, returns int | Pop() |
| Push | Adds int value to top of stack | Push(10) |
| Peek | Returns the top value from stack | Peek() |


---

### Big O


| Time | Space |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| O(n) | O(n) |

Stacks and Queues are great. They both operate very similiar, but with slight differences. Stacks utilize a LIFO or Last in first. While Queue utilizes FIFO or First in first out.
