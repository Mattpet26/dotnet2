## Perfect Sequence
*Author: Matthew Petersen*

### Problem Domain

Write the following methods that implement a Stack : isEmpty, Pop, Push and Peek

Write the following methods that implement a Queue : isEmpty, Enqueue, Dequeue and Peek.

---

### Inputs and Expected Outputs
STack
| Method | Summary | Example | 
| :-------- | :--------------------- |:----------- |
| isEmpty | Returns a boolean if stack is empty | isEmpty() |
| Pop | Removes first value in stack, returns int | Pop() |
| Push | Adds int value to top of stack | Push(10) |
| Peek | Returns the top value from stack | Peek() |

Queue
| Method | Summary | Example | 
| :-------- | :--------------------- |:----------- |
| isEmpty | Returns a boolean if queue is empty | isEmpty() |
| Enqueue | Adds int value to top of queue | Enqueue(5) |
| Dequeue | Removes top value from queue, returns int | Dequeue() |
| Peek | Returns the top value from queue | Peek() |

### Big O


| Time | Space |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| O(1) | O(1) |

Stacks and Queues are great. They both operate very similiar, but with slight differences. Stacks utilize a LIFO or Last in first. While Queue utilizes FIFO or First in first out. As you can see, both are very efficient! All the methods written above result in an O(1) time and O(1) space complexity.
